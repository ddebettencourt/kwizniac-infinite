I want to make an infinite version of the game Kwizniac. It works like Quiz Bowl, except the goal is to guess some person, place, or thing.

You're given 10 clues, from 10 to 1 points. They reveal in order, and start really hard and get easier. An example might be:

10. He threw out the first pitch at the 2005 American League Championship Series.

... more clues ...

1. He was elected president of the United States in 2008 and 2012.

answer: Barack Obama.

Players get 10 points if they answer after clue 10, and 1 point after clue 1. They get -3 points for incorrect guesses (should be adjustable
in settings per room).

Questions should be generated live by LLMs, though answers should be generated by a mechanism of choosing something that most people have heard
of. Questions can be generated by Claude 4.5 Opus (api string: claude-opus-4-5-20251101)

Guesses should be graded by LLM with a simple prompt to correct for misspellings. We should use Claude 4.5 Haiku for this (api string:
claude-haiku-4-5-20251001)


I want this to be an online multiplayer game, where everyone sees the clues as they come out, and can submit guesses with a text box.
You should be able to join/create a room. When you know something, you should be able to click a box to "buzz", and then you have
15 seconds to type in and submit your answer (everyone else is locked out). This prevents typing speed from being a factor.

This should be a nice, responsive website. You can install frameworks and things that you think would be helpful.


Design should be inspired by the following:

Design Thinking
Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:

Purpose: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
Tone: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
Constraints: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
Differentiation: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?
CRITICAL: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:

Production-grade and functional
Visually striking and memorable
Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
Meticulously refined in every detail
Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines
Focus on:

Typography: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
Color & Theme: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
Motion: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.
Spatial Composition: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
Backgrounds & Visual Details: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.
NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.

IMPORTANT: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.

Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.
